👋 Hi, I’m Vijay Krishna. I'm a Front-End-Developer.
👀 I’m interested in technologies like JavaScript, NodeJS and Python.
🌱 I’m currently learning React and Typescript and working on to create generic HOC's.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with teams who are creating generic components for their existing component libraries.
