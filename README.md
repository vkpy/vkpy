👋 Hello, I’m Vijay Krishna, an aspiring Front-End-Developer.
👀 I’m really into working with technologies like JavaScript, NodeJS and Python.
🌱 Right now, I'm diving deep into React and JavaScript / TypeScript, constantly picking up new tricks. I'm also getting the hang of NextJS and MongoDB to level up my skills in those areas.
🚀 I'm enthusiastic to dive into cool ways we can bring the latest tech into our frontend projects and making a real difference!
🤝 Additionally, I'm all about teaming up with other devs to share experiences, brainstorm ideas, and collectively tackle challenges as we explore the fascinating realm of frontend development together.
